NYC Taxis vs HVFHV — Net $ per Active Hour (Jan–Jun 2024)

Goal. Decide whether Yellow Taxi or HVFHV pays better per active hour

When you download the data make sure you put it in a folder called data.
For the external data it should look like data/external/  then the two downloaded csvs
For the zone data it should go data/fhvhv/  then the parquets for fhvhv
For the zone data it should go data/yellow/  then the parquets for yellow taxi

To see how many rows were removed for the preprocessing uncomment all the print functions

When you print the plots it will upload into a separate folder plots/img/ tehn the image name


Note the code might take a long time to output, for the preprocessing all the rows removed will be on the report, for the plots all the plots will be in the report aswell, for the wMAE and wRMSE it will be on the report. Everything my code outputs will be in the report.
